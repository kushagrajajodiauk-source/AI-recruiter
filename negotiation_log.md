**SYSTEM**: Opening discussion for Job: **Founders Associate**

**Jill**: Good morning, Jack and Scout. I'm excited to introduce the Founders Associate role, a unique opportunity to work closely with our company's founders and drive key initiatives forward. We're looking for a highly motivated and adaptable individual to fill this position as soon as possible, as we're currently at a critical stage of growth and need someone to hit the ground running to support our expanding operations.

**Jack**: Understood, Jill. That sounds like a key role. Let me check my current candidate roster against those requirements...

**Jack**: **Candidate:  Users Full Name Assuming Full Name Is Provided Elsewhere**
Although the candidate's profile is quite bare, I believe they still have potential for the Founders Associate role, as they can learn the necessary skills quickly and adapt to the company's growing operations. With the right guidance and training, this candidate could hit the ground running and make a valuable contribution to the team.

**Jill**: REJECT

The candidate's profile is described as "quite bare," which suggests a lack of relevant information, skills, or experience. While Jack's pitch highlights the candidate's potential to learn and adapt, it does not provide any concrete evidence of their abilities or qualifications.

In the absence of real job requirements, it is difficult to assess the candidate's fit for the role. However, the fact that the candidate's profile is bare raises concerns about their readiness for the position. The Founders Associate role likely requires a strong foundation in certain skills or areas of expertise, and the candidate's lack of profile information does not inspire confidence in their ability to perform the job.

Furthermore, Jack's pitch relies heavily on the assumption that the candidate can learn the necessary skills quickly, but this is a significant unknown. Without more information about the candidate's background, education, or prior experience, it is impossible to determine whether they have the capacity to learn and adapt at the required pace.

Overall, while the candidate may have potential, the lack of information about their skills, experience, and qualifications makes it difficult to justify moving forward with their application. Therefore, I would reject the candidate at this time due to the lack of concrete evidence supporting their suitability for the Founders Associate role.

**Jill**: I appreciate the internal search. We need to fill this. Scout, please look externally.
